# Bangkit-Capstone-Project-Grapy-App
Here is the repository for the Bangkit Program 2021 Capstone Project - Grapy App. A Group Therapy App that are mainly for the victim of Domestic Violence on Women and Child Abuse. 

# Overview 
Grapy App is a video conference app where victim of victim of Domestic Violence on Women and Child Abuse can meet and support each other. This app is created to help the victim to be able live their own life happily and doesn't feel depressed or alone anymore which is the main cause of suicide among the victim. In this App we used the Google Cloud Firestore functions to store the user data, we used Tflite Text Classification Machine Learning Model to predict the user personality so we can gives them reccomendation for which group therapy they could join, and we also use the Jitsi Meet API to create the video conference meeting for the Group Therapy. For this Apps, every one can use it by only registering an email account and no other information since we are prioritizing on making the user anonymous in order to protect the user identity from being exposed for those who wants to keep it a secret.
